# Gen AI Engineer

## Definition & Identity

- The **Gen AI Engineer** is a distinct role—**hybrid**, combining aspects of Agentic AI Software Engineering, architecture, and product-building.
- Unlike **AI Researchers** (who develop new models) or **ML Engineers** (who train/fine‑tune models), Gen AI Engineers focus on **building real-world products** using existing AI models.
- Tasks include: wiring up APIs, chaining prompts, connecting agents, adding guardrails, and ensuring production readiness.

## Why This Role Exists

- The rise of foundation models (GPT‑4, Claude, etc.) has created demand—not for new research, but for builders who can integrate these models into working applications.
- Job titles like **AI Engineer** or **Prompt Engineer** are increasing, driven by demand to transform demos into production-ready AI products.

## What AI Engineers Actually Do

- Build AI-powered features in applications (e.g., chatbots, document summarizers, assistants).
- Use frameworks like **LangChain**, **Mastra**, or **Agentic** to orchestrate prompt chains, memory, and actions.
- Implement **Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG)** to feed live data into models, boosting accuracy.
- Develop pipelines/tools that give AI "eyes and hands"—e.g., web search, calculations, planning.
- Handle **deployment**, **observability**, and **reliability**, ensuring systems work beyond proof-of-concept.
- Continuously refine prompt structures—**prompt engineering**, a tangible, marketable skill.

## Skills & Tooling

- **Languages**: JavaScript/TypeScript—for API integration, orchestration, and prototyping.
- **API Proficiency**: Reading LLM documentation, debugging API workflows.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Iterating on prompts, chaining instructions, designing task decomposition.
- **Framework Fluency**: LangChain, Mastra, Agentic, RAG pipelines.
- **Production Mindset**: Logging, guardrails, error handling, reliability engineering.

## Prompt Engineering

- **Introduction to Prompting**: Zero‑Shot and Few‑Shot in‑context learning; defining system vs. user prompts.
- **Context Length & Efficiency**: Managing token limits, maximizing effective context usage.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Write clear, explicit instructions.
  - Provide sufficient context.
  - Break down complex tasks into simpler subtasks.
  - Allow the model to "think" (chain-of-thought, step-by-step).
  - Iterate and refine prompts.
  - Organize and version prompts systematically.
- **RAG Beyond Texts & Agents**:
  - Implement RAG pipelines and retrieval algorithms.
  - Use agent frameworks for planning, tools, memory, and failure-mode handling.

## 6. RAG & Agents

- **RAG Architecture**: Combine retrieval systems (dense/sparse vector databases, ANN search) with LLM generation to answer using up-to-date documents.
- **Retrieval Optimization**: Techniques like hybrid sparse/dense encodings and late-interaction models for improved relevance.
- **Agent Frameworks**: Implement tools, planning, memory, multi-step workflows via orchestrators.

## 7. Fine‑tuning

- **Overview & Use Cases**:
  - When and why to fine-tune vs rely on prompt engineering.
  - Techniques for parameter-efficient tuning and multi-task fine-tuning.

  1. Enhance context inputs.
  2. Put guardrails in place.
  3. Add model routing and gateway logic.
  4. Reduce latency (caching strategies).
  5. Use agent patterns for modular actions.
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Track model behavior, errors, and outcomes in production.
- **Pipeline Orchestration**: End-to-end data and model workflows.
- **User Feedback Loop**:
  - Capture and extract conversational feedback.
  - Design feedback mechanisms and understand limitations.
  - Feed feedback into iterative prompt/model retraining cycles.

## Additional Protocols & Security Topics

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Standard released November 2024 by Anthropic, now adopted by OpenAI, Google DeepMind, etc. Standardizes how LLMs connect to context sources via JSON-RPC 2.0.
- Developers expose data via MCP servers (e.g. Slack, GitHub, CRM systems); agents query those sources securely via standardized message.
- MCP introduces new attack surfaces: server hijacking, tool shadowing, rug pulls, prompting poisoning.

### Agent‑to‑Agent Protocol (A2A)
- A Google‑introduced standard that enables communication and task delegation across heterogeneous AI agents.
- Supports collaborative AI workflows across multiple agents/platforms—key for modular, distributed systems.

### Prompt Attack & Defense Topics
- **Reverse Prompt Engineering (RPE)**: Techniques to extract hidden system prompts from outputs, even without model internals.
- **Prompt Injection / Jailbreaking**:
  - **Direct and Indirect Injection**: Attacker-written inputs or hidden instructions in retrieved data that override system prompts.
  - **Types**: Instruction wrapping, format switching, translation exploits, recursive injection, character manipulation.
- **Defensive Strategies**:
  - Input filtering, spotlighting to tag provenance of prompt segments.
  - Reinforcement learning or preference optimization (e.g. SecAlign) to train LLMs against injected prompts.
  - Guardrails and least-privilege design for MCP tools; review and filter data before execution.
- **Information Extraction**: Securely extracting structured info from untrusted sources while avoiding prompt manipulation.
- **Defenses Against Prompt Attacks**: Combining filters, human oversight, red teaming, safe tool design.
